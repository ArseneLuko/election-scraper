# Election scraper

# How to run it
Run the main script 'scraper.py' with at least one arguments - the name of district you want results (more details below). Second argument is name of a csv file (without file extension), but if you omit 2nd argument script will run and save results to the file results.csv (note it will overwrite an older one if exists). You can list all districts by run script with 'seznam' argument.

## Name of district - first argument
Input a region name, use exact form as it is stored. For help run 'scraper.py seznam'

## File name - second argument
Input file name without spaces as a second argument. Everything after a space after second argument will be ignored.
You can ommit '.csv' extension, will be added automaticaly.
